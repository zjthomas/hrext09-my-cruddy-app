 ## Tasks

 ### Basic Reqs
- [ ] Where to store data? (localstorage)
- [ ] How to caputure data? (web form)
- [ ] How to modify data? (update action, delete action)
- [ ] How to view data? (style?)
- [ ] UI/UX considerations (how are we going to use this)

 ### Advanced Reqs
- [ ] Item that I added goes here...

***************************************************************************************************************************

Sauces: displays/ share sauces (hot sauce/ salsa recipes / other sauce) (open-sauce cooking)

name  = {
	ingredients: {
		ingredient: quantity,
		etc.
		notes: ......
	},
	diections: {
		step1: ....,
		step2: ....,
		etc.
	},
	description: {
		descprition text: ....., (limit length 500 characters to avoid personal naratives)
		uses: [chicken, stir-fry, ...etc],
		spicyness: 1-10,
		type: fresh/fermented/vinegar, etc. ** [] for multiple types? (maybe limit to 3 to keep it specific)
		time: how long it takes to make (minutes)
	}
}

Basic Goals: 
- [ ] add, view, delete, and modify sauce recipes
- [ ] search by sauce name, ingredients, spicyness, uses


Advanced Goals:
- [ ] be able to track/view recipe changes over time (git sauce), try out variations and record them and then either merge to be your official recipe, make a new sauce out of that, or discard it and keep the old one.
- [ ] include recipes for main dishes and sides
- [ ] generate recomended main dish/side/sauce combos based on a chosen sauce, dish, side, or ingredient
- [ ] create social network (saucebook or sauce-tagram, sauced'in for profesional chefs) with personal profiles where you and other people can share their recipes (only recipes no politics) and you can save other peoples recipes to include in generated recomendations
- [ ] can also 'fork' a recipe and then add in your own tweaks to it as well
- [ ] be able to add photos and videos (limit number and length so they get to the point and don't tell pointless stories)
